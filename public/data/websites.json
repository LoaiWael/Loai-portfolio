      "doc": "As part of the development team for our coffee shop e-commerce platform at DEPI, I was responsible for the UI/UX implementation and system stability. I designed and coded the page layouts, prioritizing a clean structure and ease of navigation. To drive user engagement, I integrated smooth animations that guided users through the purchasing flow. Simultaneously, I focused on application resilience by developing comprehensive error-handling protocols; this ensured that exceptions were managed gracefully, maintaining the integrity of the application and guiding users effectively when unexpected errors occurred.",
